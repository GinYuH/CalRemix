"Body": "A traumatized fisherman recounts his encounter with the 'Undead Gauntlet' in the Timeless Shores: 'The water turned black as five armored figures rose, their hollow eyes burning with Ilmeris' old vengeance. They moved as one, chanting in a tongue that made my blood boil.' The witness escaped only after the knights abruptly halted, as if sensing a greater threat. Authorities advise avoiding the area until the Godseekers investigate.",
