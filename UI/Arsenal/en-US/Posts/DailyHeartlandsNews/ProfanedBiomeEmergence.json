  "Body": "**URGENT:** The Godseeker Knights have issued a **crisis edict** after seismic disturbances revealed a landmass of 'unholy radiance' rising from an undisclosed location. Scout reports describe towering **obsidian monoliths** wreathed in golden fire, with the Profaned Guardians standing sentinel over what appears to be a *gateway*. The Knights condemn the biome as a 'blasphemous echo' of divine realms, warning that 'no mortal should tread where even gods falter.' Despite this, rogue scholars argue the site predates the Knights themselvesâ€”citing carvings of a 'Cradle of Embers' where Providence may have first stirred. Profaned creatures of all varieties, now withdrawing from the Hallow and Underworld, and rogue loyalists to the Gods seem to be converging here. Is this their reckoning... or ours?",
