"Body": "Wanderers beware: the Lone Ronin 'Statis' has been sighted near the Dungeon, executing those who 'disrespect the balance.' One survivor claims Statis pursued them for days, relenting only after they slew a Profaned Guardian. The Ronin's sword allegedly drains vitality on contact, leaving victims 'aged decades in seconds.' The Dryads have issued a bulletin: 'Do not provoke the blade that weeps.'",
