"Body": "Wanderers beware: the Lone Ronin 'Statis' has been sighted near the Dungeon, executing those who 'disrespect the balance.' One survivor claims Statis pursued them for days, relenting only after they slew a Perforator Worm. Some claim to these outbursts are due to the recent loss of Braelor, the Ronin's 'hunk boyfriend' to the Devourer of Gods. The Dryads have issued a bulletin: 'Do not provoke the blade that weeps.'",
