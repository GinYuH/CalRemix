"Body": "High-ranking Godseeker Knights have declared the 'Yharmy' initiative operational. Six elite units, each bearing relics of fallen gods, will conduct 'cleansing operations' in regions with residual divine energy. A leaked missive states: 'The Age of False Idols ends now.' Residents living in affected areas are urged to stay indoors, and not interupt the Godseeker Knights.",
