  "Body": "SCOOP: Recent expeditions into the Brimstone Crags have revealed a shocking truth—the scorched wastelands we once believed to be the entirety of the region are merely the *outskirts* of a far grander ruin. Beyond the sulfurous fissures lies the buried metropolis of **Azafure**, a labyrinth of blackened citadels and collapsed arcane infrastructure. Explorers report a strange suppression field within the city’s limits—referred to by locals as **'The Weight of the Fallen'**—that renders all forms of aerial movement inert, forcing traversal by foot through its perilous streets. The ruins appear to be sealed by an ancient ward, one that scholars speculate is tied to the Brimstone Elemental’s presence. Further investigations are underway, but one thing is clear: we’ve only glimpsed the surface of what the Crags truly hide.",
