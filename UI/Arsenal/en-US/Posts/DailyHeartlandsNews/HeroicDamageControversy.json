  "Body": "**EXCLUSIVE:** Battlemages and berserkers are in uproar over leaked research from the **Onyx Kinsmen** studying 'Heroic Damage,' a latent force that amplifies certain weapons *exclusively* against towering foes.

Critics call it 'favoritism for the foolhardy,' arguing it undermines disciplined combat. The **Godseeker Knights** have reportedly begun retrofitting armor and relics to harness the effect, but traditionalists accuse them of 'rewarding bad tactics.' Meanwhile, the melee underground is thriving: 'Finally,' says one anonymous gladiator, 'the Gods respect my suffering.' #HeroicOrHype",
