"Body": "Archaeologists excavating in the deep caverns of the Heartlands have uncovered a previously unknown minibiome brimming with luminous pink crystals. These structures emit a faint hum and seem to resonate with any surrounding crystaline structures. Initial reports suggest the crystals may have been part of an ancient Auric ritual site, though their exact purpose remains unknown. Locals claim touching them induces visions of 'a heart surrounded by gleaming artwork.'",
