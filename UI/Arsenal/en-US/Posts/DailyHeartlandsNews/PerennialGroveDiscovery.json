  "Body": "EXCLUSIVE: Botanists venturing beyond the Vernal Pass claim to have stumbled upon a previously undocumented ecosystem—the **Perennial Grove**, an overgrown ruin where nature has reclaimed forgotten structures. The air hums with latent magic, and strange **jade-green crystals** (tentatively dubbed 'Perennial Jade') pulse within the bark of ancient trees, replacing older mineral deposits. Early samples suggest the crystals grow *organically*, as if the grove itself is alive. Local wildlife appears altered by exposure, with reports of floral-encrusted creatures and drifting seedpod mimics. Scholars are debating whether the grove is a natural phenomenon or the remnant of a lost cultivation experiment. One thing’s certain: tread carefully—those vines might be watching you back.",
