  "Body": "**CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE LEAKED:** Internal Draedon Labs combat trials reveal the **Murasama Prototype V.Σ**, a high-frequency blade that dynamically adapts to its wielder’s combat style. Recovered footage showcases four distinct attack modes: \n- **Iaido Precision:** The classic single slash, now with refined particle trails. \n- **Tectonic Cleave:** A charged strike that reportedly 'split a rogue Guardian’s armor like parchment.' \n- **Blade Typhoon:** Rapid swings that create a localized distortion field, shredding anything caught within. \n- **Cyclone Saw:** A spinning death blossom that left testing dummies 'unrecognizable' (per lab notes). \n\nThe weapon’s new **modular upgrade station** allows users to install 'Badges'—classified augmentations that tweak its physics-defying properties. Meanwhile, cosmetic skins (including a rumored **community-designed variant**) suggest Draedon plans to monetize *aesthetic violence*. \n\nControversy erupted after scholars noted the blade’s resemblance to a pre-Collapse *fictional* weapon. Draedon’s PR team responded: 'All innovation is iterative. Also, sue us.' #NotASamuraiReference",
