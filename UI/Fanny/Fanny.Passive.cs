I too enjoy the fruits of the Calamity modification for Terraria. I find joy and bliss in the contents of this articulately, well-crafted piece of art for such a highly-praised video game, and you too flame. You've been such a helpful assistant in my goals of terraforming this world as my own, decorating it finely with my creations comparable to an artist and their fine-tipped paintbrush upon a felt canvas. Without the presence of your partnership, I would fall into an ever-growing pit of confusion, despair, darkness and misery as a result of the overwhelming unknown knowledge of such world that we're in, but you've helped me to glimpse into the beauty of this world and see it for what it truly is. Together, we've built up a community of all races, gender, and species, forever welded with the light that comes with friendship. We've truly managed to create a perfect version of such community, a remix of sorts. As we tread on through the lands stained by past calamities, through the infernum of the dragons and against the catalyst of the cosmos' gift, we can face the wrath of the gods together, forging our path through the stars above the birds and the foliage together, with every twist and turn bringing a new challenge for all of us. Us, as in our community. At such point in time, however, one cannot simply call it, a \"community\" anymore. We are family. With each victory we achieve, we gain a new melody in our symphony of the world. And when the final battle comes, when we stand face-to-face with the deities too unfathomable to describe, we'll still yet to back down. With our hearts alight with fire, our weapons ready, and the wisdom of our journey together, we shall strike down the final calamity with a grace only we could understand! Grazing through fields of the razor-sharp tentacles that the cerloise-painted scules bear, we stand together as a remix of this community. We are, Community Remix.");
