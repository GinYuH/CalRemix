And what do you know, nestled at the bottom of the abyss, in a chest covered in barnacles and seaweed, was a sight to behold: my dear old dad's prized artifact, a slab made of moonstone with a fiery red eye staring back at me.",

For though my dear old dad may not see eye to eye with me, I've proven time and time again that I'm more than just a flame in the wind.",
