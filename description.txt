It contains an absolutely gorgeous array of high quality content, including (but not limited to):
-The Wulfrum Excavator boss! (With more bosses on the horizon!)
-Lots of accessories! (Including the legendary Verboten One!) (Quantity AND quality!)
-A wide array of weapons! (High-caliber!)
-Multiple fantastic generated things, such as shrines! (Exploration!!)
And many more secrets (Ooo!)

More is (not) soon to come!!!

Suffer.

Multiplayer support? What's that?
