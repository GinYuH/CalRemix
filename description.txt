From the creators of the XP-00 Hypnos Mod, we bring you the Calamity: Community Remix addon!
It contains an absolutely gorgeous array of high quality content, including (but not limited to):
-The Wulfrum Excavator boss! (Technical!)
-Like, a ton of elemental construct bosses! (Seriously, what were these developers thinking? I can't imagine what he was going for, putting like 8 variants of the same boss in the game. This is a terrible idea, and everybody involved should be UTTERLY ASHAMED.)
-Lots of accessories! (Including the legendary Verboten One!) (Quantity AND quality!)
-A wide array of weapons! (High-caliber!)
-Multiple fantastic generated things, such as shrines! (Exploration!!)
-MANY progression changes, with many new items to use and discover! (Newgame+!)
And many more secrets (Ooo!)

More is (not) soon to come!!!

Suffer.

Multiplayer support? What's that?
