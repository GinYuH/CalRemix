FBIGUY: An agent of a mysterious organization. His motive is to arrest the one reponsible for designing the Codebreaker.
ZER0: There is a rumor that this bird is really a dragon, but rumors are just rumors.
KABLOOEY: Nobody is really sure who they are, and nobody's dared to ask. Despite being on the team against Yharim, others seem not to take much a liking to them. It's not fully because they like to be reclusive, it's why they are reclusive. Everyone, including themselves, fear their power. With a simple wave of the hand, they can instantly combust and detonate whatever they please. Despite this power being well controlled, being so useful Yharim targeted them first, they fear what would happen if they used their power irresponsably.
SIIVA: Unlike her many allies during the war with Yharim, Silva was not trained by the ancient scholars, but rather by nature itself. Despite her differences, she was instrumental for the war as she had kept the armies fed by sprouting crops from seemingly thin air.
IRON: Quick-witted and quicker on his feet, his mastery of energy is nothing to scoff at. He may be a cheery guy, but he's incredibly powerful when need be, able to fry several targets in an instant. Once Yharim insulated his forces, he was left to power the rest of the armada. He may be strong, but his jokes leave a watt to be desired.
WALTER: A master of the shadows, this powerful magus dominated the battlefield from behind the scenes by conjuring up plagues and diseases to weaken the onslaught of enemies. She struggled against Yharim's mechanical forces, however, so she resorted to crafting antidotes and strategizing to contribute to the battle.
EDGY: A very tempered and collected individual. Despite the wild nature of fire, she holds a very cold and collected attitude. Some say this is to help better control the flames. She, alongside Permafrost were at the forefront of the armada's offense against Yharim's armies. Working together, two polarizing elements combine to shatter the target, and nothing could withstand temperature shock. No matter the machine, they would eventually break through with enough time and support. It would take a devil of a machine to quell them. Maybe even multiple.
BALLER: This powerful witch used her ability to manipulate winds to turn the tide of battle during the war with Yharim. Being able to create powerful drafts with just a wave of her hands, she lifted arships into the sky to cover ground much quicker and carry troops to their stations.
UNCANNY: This powerful wizard is feared across the land for his ability to manipulate the cells in the bodies of his enemies to destroy them from the inside out. Though his magics can be used for violence, they can be used for healing too which made him the leading medic against the war with Yharim.
WALLSTREET: Buy low, sell high! Hailing from an unknown dimension on the other side of a mysterious golden portal, this enthusiastic broker has created this world's only stock exchange. Reportedly, he is so wealthy that he had to invent a new unit of currency just to show how much money he has.
Astigmageddon: One eye.
AuricSlime: A slime that has successfully fused with godly matter. It is a wonder that these have taken so long to evolve considering how easily they can absorb other ores.

Baroncrab: Despite their profound knowledge, some Barocrabs seek for higher knowledge. To achieve this, they attune with the Baron Strait's Tanzanite to achieve a new status.

Conjunctivirus: Green eye.
CosmicSlime: It seems that slimes are now conquering other galaxies.
CrocodileHerring: This fish species was doomed for extinction from the start considering females of the species were exponentially larger and less common. It's a wonder they somehow lived until the modern day.
CyberDraedon: A holographic replica of Draedon himself. This projection acts as a layer of defense against both software and hardware threats within the labs.
Dendritiator: The one who alerts the rest of the immune system of foreign intruders. It uses its tentacles to drag in invaders too their doom or call in more defenders.
Ecolium: A violent strain of bacteria whose goal is to cause as many ruptures as possible.
EnchantedSkull: Many have tried to breach the stronghold's walls and many have failed to leave a dent on them. However, in the afterlife, they got their wish and now patrol the fort's inner sanctums.
EnchantedTome: It's strange why so many magicians are obsessed with sentient books. Who does this help? Does it just help them read better? Are individuals really so lazy that they need a book to move on its own for them?
Eosinine: Allergens are a common and consistent problem throughout the world. Cells like these are always ready to combat them.

GreenDemon: Eat vegetables and fruits to become strong. LIKE ME!
GulletWorm: I am a grub that lives in the soil.
Hydrogen: This machination of Yharim's artillery proved to be a challenge to fuse both magic and science cohesively. While Ivy's soul comfortably sits outside the construct, Hydrogen's power resonates with her mana; down to its devastating explosion.
Ionogen: As one of Surge's failed creations, Ionogen was casted out to the sulphurous sea as a quick means of disposable. Unfortunately, the quick-evolving ecosystem claimed the outdated tech as one of its own constructs.

OnyxKinsman: Husbando gone wild.
OrigenCore: This element was once the first wielder of the Zero Point. After his untimely demise to a party of two John Wicks, Master Chief, and Rick, he was severed from the omniverse to bring upon superior clones of itself.
Oxygen: In a magical blunder, this construct found itself a resident of the elemental family as an unwilling eye of her storm. While Tempest carried a plethora of cargo on Yharim's behalf, she slipped into her airstream which sparked a feedback loop outside her control.
Pathogen: This elemental's traits stick close to its creator; espionage. After an unfavorable encounter with Yharim's forces, Calamitas' remarks on Mona's tendencies soon doomed her to a fate of virality. All that remains of the archmagus is an imitation of her bread and butter.
Phytogen: After Silva's banishment to the Abyss, a sizeable chunk of her spirit fractured from her rotting body to return to the jungle. This elemental's purified core manifested as a construct to combat against the plague and its carriers.

TheCalamity: An entity made of unseen light taken form by the anger and grievances of many. Probably.
Tobasaia: Among all of the viscous invading microbes, this one is unique in that it seems to go after plant-life instead of animal-life. How lost it is.
WhiteBloodCell: Common defenders of the body. Through the combined efforts of all of them, they keep their ecosystem safe.
WulfwyrmHead: An aged project of an esteemed scientist. It appears to be barely functional.
Hypnos: A cerebral dreadnaught, and quite possibly one of Draedon’s finest creations. While the usage of gray matter is questionable, the feat of getting a brain to interface with cybernetics is impressive.

Corruption: EXULHG DOLYH.
CrimsonKaiju: For generations, many saw kaiju as nigh indestructible god-like beings, only being defeatable through long fights with other kaiju. The Crimson Kaiju's ability to quickly slaughter dozens of other kaiju proved them wrong.

TheLeashHead: A grotesque cord of synthetic flesh designed to prevent the Twins from growing seperate. Should one of them be defeated, it will quickly eject itself for self preservation and await a new duo of eyes. Should none be available for it, it will attempt to create them itself- often, those who have defeated the great seers of the night are quick to drop their guard, making them easy pickings for the one piece of it they glossed over.
BoarCat: Once thought to be a mythical creature, the Boar Cat is indeed very real. Get your cameras!
FrostHog: I was going to write an entry here, but mmmm I'm just thinking about Delicious Meat right now...
Xeroc: The origin of the red moon. Just a single gaze of this fiend is able to throw planets into madness.

KillerPolyp: An anemone is an enemy and this anemone is certainly no different if you ignore the fact it doesn't deal any damage.
Stanchor: Wartorn and scarred, this anchor has been through a lot. These days, it's retired and decided it would rather act like a swinging axe than a heavy anchor.
