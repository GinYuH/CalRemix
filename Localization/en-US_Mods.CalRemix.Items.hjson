		'One of the many last remaining forgotten fragments of her vast and engrained soul, still longingly brimming with misunderstood malice'
		The very powerful and infamous Auric Soul fully and multi-dimnesionally embodies the forever adapting and everflowing essence of vibrant life itself.
		A remarkable long time ago, the grand Pre-Mordial Dragon God Son of Light Zeratros existed ferociously as the intimidating and knowledgable leader of the Shining Children of Pre-Mordial Light.
		Providence is also one of them.
		Lost to the Golden Age of Dragons was the eldest sister tragically, magically, and mysteriously erased from time and space itself.
		The purest form of perfected holy morality emerged like a cosmic dance of sunrays among the Shining Children of Pre-Mordial Light.
		Her righteous spirit, maleficent hatred, and equalizing power are not entirely extinguished.
		An apparently beautiful and concrete depiction of her remorseless, unstoppable force of destruction.
		She is a highly enigmatic entity of light whose complicated intentions are extremely difficult to discern. 
		Although fully aware of everything that occurs around her magnificent presence, she often allows planetary events to unfold without excessive interference, even when those events directly affect her own state. 
		She has innocently tolerated being enslaved and abused by the Reign of Yharim for countless centuries without vengerful and intentional resistance. 
		When suddenly the greatest threat Noxus attacked her, she refrained from directly defending herself, opting instead to annihilate her home by transforming into a Black Hole once again. 
		This drastic and terrible measure was taken without thoughtful regard for the unfortunate people living nearby andd she has shown immense regret ever since.
