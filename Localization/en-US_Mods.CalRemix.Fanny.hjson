CystDeath: See!
Roxcalibur: That's a Roxcalibur! You could shimmer it and try and get things earlier to make lategame easier!
Kinsman: Watch out! I'm sensing a strange elemental field coming from that onyx drill! Brace yourself for a fight!
Grimesand: See that weird dark splotch over there? That is Grimesand, it's pretty grimey. You can throw evil materials onto it for epic rewards or lead enemies into it for scary stuff to happen.
CalamityRing1: No way, it's a Calamity Ring! These terrible rings were manufactured by the King Yharim to turn people into eyes! You'd better not wear it, otherwise you'll take double damage from all sources!
CalamityRing2: How come it doesn't turn them into an eye? Why's it only make them take more damage? That isn't even mentioned in the flavor text!
CalamityRing3: "                                                                                                                                                                                           "
CalamityRing4: I don't know
EssentialEssenceDisbelief: You better have gotten that from shimmering cores, otherwise that's genuinely fucking embarassing, man. Did you really waste your time getting every single component? You probably had most of this stuff lying around, but even then. You can't even do jack shit with ONE bar! How many more of these are you gonna craft?? You like, genuinely repulse me. I feel like I'm going to barf in my own mouth just from looking at you. NOBODY is impressed by the fact you're willing to waste your time resource gathering. The starter bag came with a red pickaxe for a reason, get to learning the codes.
AuricSlime: Look! A rare Auric Slime! It's fascinating how fascinated that fascinating humans are with these fascinating creatures. Such is the inner-machinations of the natural animalistic instinct to complete a collection.
BananaClown: Wuh oh! A Banana Clown! Don't get too close to them or you'll go bananas cleaning up the terrain damage they cause!
Barocrab: Oooh, a Barocrab! You should go approach it and say hello! I heard they’re friendly and know of an ancient art called... the "Crab Secret".
BarocrabRun: Oh no it ran away! Now you'll never be able to learn the Crab Secret... Well, at least not until another one appears.
Carcinogen: A giant floating chunk of asbestos with cigars orbitting it? Now I've seen it all...
Hydrogen: Hey! Do you see that spiky balloon chained over there? Word has it that hitting it with explosives will unleash a terrible evil, capable of destroying the entire sea! But something so destructive couldn't possibly exist, right?
Ionogen: What a shocking turn of events! All I have to say is watch out for battery acid! It's this domino's most deadliest attack!
Origen: It appears you are being punished for home invasion!
Oxygen: Oxygen is quite the fickle foe. Many have died foolishly trying to take a crack at it on the surface. However, that glass shell doesn't seem to be built for pressure. Try leading it to the bottom of the Abyss!
OxygenEvil: Ok look, Fanny may be an imbecile, but if you're gonna take any words of his to heart it should be these. Leading it to the abyss is the only way you're defeating this idiotic ball.
Pathogen: It seems through your efforts, you've awoken Pathogen! I hope you've been helping the viruses, or you'll be in a sick situation! and not in the good way!
Pythogen: Makes fronds, not enemies.
Mammoth: My goodness, is that a Wooly Mammoth?!? This world must be in the Stone Age! Go get a look while you can, before they go extinct!
Fushigi: Look at you, finding a floating glass ball stuck in some rocks! If you break the rocks above it, that ball will rise like it's got somewhere to be. But beware, if it escapes the ocean, you'll be in for some seriously wild wind! Hold onto your hat, or it might fly away faster than my jokes at a comedy show!
"Green Demon": Gee wilickers! A Green Demon! These guys pack a real punch, but they are absolutely TERRIFIED of radioactive toads! or was it frogs? salamanders? Well either way you better catch some!
CyberDraedonFight: It appears you have alerted the high urgency security systems within that projector and summoned the nefarious Cyber Draedon. He's a real fickle foe who is able to deal percentage-based damage, meaning he'll always be a threat no matter how good your defenses and health are!
KingMinnows: A king minnows prime! This fish is known for yelling out “die!” Which is a subtle reference to the fact that it will kill you! This reference is best observed on the Death mode difficulty.
LifeBiome: The Life Heart is a joint meeting area of the elements of fire, ice, and nature. With their powers combined, they make a powerful new bar which can be used to upgrade your items! Be careful of the dreaded Life Slimes that visciously guard the place though.
KinsmenFight: Quick! Get him! He's escaping with a one of a kind item!
Ogscule: That Ogsculian Burrower over there. A dangerous foe. The best course of action here is to jump over them to dodge their laser of doom.
Aspid: Uh oh! A Primal Aspid! Best be wary around those buggers as killing too many may subject you to ancient ice spells!
Gastropod: The slug lives? And on top of that it seems invincible? Well that's inconvenient! Maybe try waiting things out and seeing if something happens?
Gastropod2: That slime right there! Try leading the gastropod into it and its projectiles, he seems sludgephobic!
OgslimeAwakening: O-Ogslime!?!?

TrapperBeginning8: Oh come fucking on.
BizarroFannyIntro: HIHIHI I'm FFFFanny the Flame! I willGuide you throU GH this [[The infinite cosmos di[still[ upon the nigh end of a [real[ity under[ the blossoms[ of death[
ML1: Blegh, I think I swallowed one of that thing's bones. Well, it's time for Godseeker Mode. You will face a sequence of challenges, each more difficult than the last with little to no breathing between encounters.
ML2: Almost sounds like a boss rush or something.
ML3: A priority you should take care of immediately is harvesting Unholy Essence from some new, fearsome creatures that have appeared in the Underworld and Hallow. You can then use the essence to make the Rune of Kos and summon the Rune of Kos bosses.
ML4: You can find 3 different types of cosmic remains if you search the sky, one of them is the remains of the Moon guy you just defeated! Second one is some exotic clusters used for some artifacts! Third one is the distorted remains of Cosmos itself.
ML5: The Dungeon has also gotten an upgrade in power, with new spirit enemies that occasionally pop out of enemies when defeated which drop Phantoplasm, an important crafting material. I'd reccomend killing as many of those things as possible!
ML6: I'm getting a bit of deja vu here.
ML7: It appears that the red moon will start yielding bountiful harvests of Blood Orbs now! You should take advantage of this opportunity to craft lotsa potions! I'm personally a fan of the Inferno Potion myself.
ML8: Are you feeling a little weak? It may be because of the dreaded 'Curse of the Eldritch', a terrifying affliction inflicted upon those who slay eldritch beasts which permanently reduces your life regeneration!
ML9: I should also mention that if you have a certain thief in one of your towns, they'll start selling the flawless Celestial Reaper, which can be used to cut down herbs significantly faster than the normal Sickle.
ML10: Oh oh I should also mention-
ML11: Oh my god shut up already, how much can one boss unlock!?
ML12: HELLO !!!
ML13: I'm out.
ML14: Wait! Evil Fanny, come back! Don't worry friend, I'll make sure she comes back. Just give me a second to chat with her.
ML15: IT IS SUCH A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, MY NEW FRIEND! My name? Ohoho, I am none other then the incredible, fantastical, miraculous Miracle Boy!
ML16: I have so much to teach you, especially with all the drovel that utterly unscrumptious flame was spewing...
RemixJump: Hey there friend! I noticed your jumps were a little too weak, so I added a bit of my Fanny-spice and now you can jump TWO times! I hope you enjoy this!
LowHP: It looks like you're low on health. If your health reaches 0, you'll die. To combat this, don't let your health reach 0!
Invisible: Where did you go?
DarkArea: Fun fact. The human head can still be conscious after decapitation for the average of 20 seconds.
ConstantDeath: Is that someone behind you...?
Cursed: Looks like you've been cursed! If you spam Left Click, you'll be able to use items again sooner!
OctFebruary: Did you know? 31 in Octagonal is the same as 25 in Decimal! That means OCT 31 is the same as DEC 25! Happy Halloween and Merry Christmas!
DungeonGuardian: It appears you're approaching the Dungeon. Normally this place is guarded by viscious guardians, but I've disabled them for you my dear friend.
MeldGunk: In a remote location underground, there is a second strain of Astral Infection. If left unattended for too long, it can start spreading and dealing irreversible damage! Stay safe and happy hunting!
MeldHeart: Look at all that gunk! I'm pretty sure it's impossible to break it, so the best solution I can give is to assure it doesn't spread further by digging around it.
MeldHeartNoxus: Look at all that gunk! I'm pretty sure it's impossible to break it, well, maybe if you got some powerful spray bottle, but that might take a while, so the best solution I can give is to assure it doesn't spread further by digging around it.
IonGuy: Hey there, beachcomber! Looks like you've found a talking panel in that trash pile! It's wired up and ready to chat, but beware—it’s probably going to ask you for items. Remember, not all that glitters is gold, and not all talking panels are trustworthy. You might end up giving away your favorite pair of socks!
Tangerine: Have you ever heard of the Sanguine Tangerine? Also going by other names such as Hemagrape or Blood Orange, this rare fruit can only be found by submerging an Apple into water during the Blood Moon. It's like comparing apples to oranges! or converting rather.
MiracleFruitNOTBoy: Hey there, sky-gazer! You’ve been around long enough to know about those little planetoids up in space, right? Well, something miraculous has started sprouting on the Jungle ones! Maybe take a little trip up there and see if you can find something fruity to boost your vitality! Just don’t let gravity ruin your snack time!
Oldberry: Hey there, plant barterer! You know how you can trade those Strange Plants for dyes right? Well did you know the Dye Trader’s got more than just fashion sense? Hand over a few more, and you might just get something elderly… but in a good way! Boosting your health never looked so stylish!
Dargonfruit: Hey there, angler extraordinaire! Sky Lakes have some pretty cool treasures, but if you’re after something legendary for your health, you’ll need a little extra flair! Try fishing while a Wyvern is soaring around—those crates seem to like a little bit of danger! Just don’t let the big noodle knock you out before you can reel in your prize!
Ethcore: If you’re looking to boost your mana, the Astral Beacon might be the key. All you need is something special to trigger it—maybe a certain bloody item? If you’ve got the right one, it’ll open the door to something ethereal. Just be cautious; you’re dealing with powerful forces.
Novashard: Those Nova creatures sure love crashing into things, huh? If you can lure one into slamming straight into some Astral Ore, you might just find something stellar left behind. Just try not to get caught in the blast yourself—unless you want a front-row seat to the fireworks.
Phart: Keep an eye on the ground, just like how stars fall from the sky, Phantom Hearts will occasionally rise up from below. They don’t stick around for long, so if you spot one, grab it quick! It’ll give your mana a boost that feels like a glimpse into the unknown.
Multiplayer: The atmosphere seems a lot more social than what I'm used to. Be wary of ruptures in reality!
Adrenaboy1: My-my! You sure are bolting like chili bean potatoes, my friend!
Adrenaboy2: Ha-ha! Good one, Miracle Boy!
Adrenaboy3: Explain it then.
Adrenaboy4: Well.. uh.. chili is spicy.. and adrenaline is what you get as a flight or fight response..
Adrenaboy5: That wasn't the intention of my joke, flame.
Norcheese: Something, something, you dirty cheater.
Annivenriersary1: HAPPY 20TH ANNIVERSARY, $0! We've had a lot of fun adventures over these last two decades, and here's to two more!
Annivenriersary2: ... Fanny? What the fuck are you talking about? It's barely been one year, let alone twenty of them. Did you eat another lotus, or something?
Annivenriersary3: Trapper-Chan LOVES celebrating, but twenty seems strange... a-are you okay, Fanny-Kun?

Babil1: Hey there, adventurer! Have you heard about the Essence of Babil? It's this amazing crafting material that drops from certain jungle creatures. Let me give you some tips on how to find it!
Babil2: Oh you sweet summer child! The Essence of Babil is this incredible, mystical substance you can gather from jungle enemies. It's a key ingredient for crafting some seriously awesome gear. You should definitely try to collect it!
Babil3: Seriously? I just told you, it drops from jungle creatures. You know, those critters lurking around in the jungle biome? Go hunt them down, and you might get your hands on some Essence of Babil!
Babil4: The Essence of Babil used for crafting powerful items. You can create some fantastic air-themed equipment with it. Seriously, just check the crafting menu, it's all there!
Babil5: Okay, let me spell it out for you one more time. Essence of Babil is a crafting material. You find it in the jungle. You use it to make cool stuff. Got it now? Good!
Babil6: Hey there, adventurer... Have you heard about the Essence of Babil? It's this... remarkable crafting material that drops from such unworthy jungle creatures. Let me grace you with some information, whether you appreciate it or not.
Babil7: Oh, how utterly clueless. The Essence of Babil is this incredibly mundane substance you can get from jungle enemies. You might even consider it somewhat important for crafting marginally useful gear. But, hey, who cares, right?
Babil8: Seriously? I can't believe I have to repeat myself. It drops from those jungle creatures, assuming you can manage to defeat them, of course. Go ahead, give it a shot. Not like it matters.
Babil9: You're really pushing your limits here, aren't you? It's used to craft... well, whatever. You can create some totally average air-themed equipment. But, honestly, who cares about that, right?
Babil10: Of course, you don't!!! Why would I expect any different? Essence of Babil is just a crafting material. You find it in the jungle. You use it to make "cool" stuff, if you're into that sort of thing. But, frankly, I couldn't care less.
Babil11: You think you "get it"? You're beyond hopeless! There, now you're truly enlightened. Enjoy your essence... of oblivion!
Dog1: Jeez! That Cosmic Serpent has a new layer of protection! Don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle. You've fought foes that I'm sure were much tougher than this snake. Your previous combat encounters have given you the tools AND skills required to beat this oversized noodle to the ground, AND you have me by your side! Just remember to stay focused, and keep your eyes on his head!
Dog2: ...Actually, I think I have some tips on hand for this guy. Let me see here...
Dog3: ...Alright. It says here that the Devourer of Gods, also known as the Nameless Serpent, is a colossal worm originating from... Hold on. He's the "Nameless Serpent"? That's not much of a name! And besides, he's already referred to as the Devourer of Gods. Oh well, that doesn't matter right now. Anyways, he came from the Distortion World. He's here under the Reign of Yharim to, as his title implies, devour Gods. Right now, he has a resistance to Magic, Poison, and Dark. If you have any weapons that are augmented to those elements, I wouldn't recommend using them! At least right now. Without his armor, he has a pretty significant weakness to slash-type weapons. If you can catch him again without any armor, try using something that slashes! Anyways, what else is there here...
Dog4: ...Okay, it says some stuff about his attack patterns here. Right now, he should probably be ramming into you. It says here the best strategy to combat that is through a shield that lets you penetrate... What does that mean? "Lets you penetrate". Penetrate what? His head? I guess it's telling you to dash through his head? Try doing that! When he isn't dashing, hes performing one of his other laser-based attacks.  The first one listed here shows a picture with a bunch of lines pointing inwards towards a player. It looks like the best way to avoid that attack is to follow the blind spots. Try moving towards any air you can see! The next one kind of looks like a Star of David made out of laser lines... Can I call them that? The little telegraphs? Yeah, I think i'll call them laser lines. Okay, so the laser lines are all pointing inwards from six evenly-spaced portals at the "points" of the star. It says here you should try and stand still when the portals appear, and move towards the blind spots when the laser lines are solid! So try doing that!! Gimme a second to read a little further...
Dog5: ...Yep! The next attack shown here has sort of a big grid look going on. Jeez, it almost looks like a lightshow! This is all starting to remind me of when I went to a rave. It was 2013, and I was young... Well, younger than I was now. There were a lot of things there that I feel like this titanic invertebrate took notes from, most notably the laser lights! The color palette's even the same... Do you think he went to the same place as I? Or did he just buy them for cheap when they went out of business? Well, whatever the case, this attack looks like you need to dodge it by standing inside of the gaps produced by the lasers. But be careful! It looks like sometimes the laser grid tilts!... I'm not sure how that impacts the dodgability of it all, but whatever. I'm not the Devourer of Gods here. Yet. I've always wanted to be a Godslayer Inferno... Well, I'm getting ahead of myself! You still need help with this guy! Fortunately, there's only one attack left in the second phase section. Sometimes, he'll enter a portal. Another portal will appear near you, with a big blue line coming out of it! But don't worry! It says here that the line doesn't do damage. However, he will dash out of the portal by following the line! The line will try to predict your movement, so move and then stop moving when he's coming out of the portal so that he comes out in front of you instead of on top of you! Did you get that? If so, then you're all good to go! Good luck out there, champ!
Dog6: ...Hold on, I was reading the Infernum section.
Dog7: Okay, alright. I'm reading the right chapter now. Though, keep my previous words in mind! Maybe he might... Start using Infernum AI, or something. Do we even have that mod on right now? Oh whatever, there isn't enough time to fret about that right now. I have some tip-giving to do! Anyways kid, you should be focusing on his two phases. In case you haven't noticed, the Devourer has been flipping between his purple and blue phases for a fair bit now. While he's in those phases, he'll act differently. While he's feeling blue (Haha, get it? Feeling blue?) he'll try and stick above you, keeping an eye out for if you make any mistakes. If you go too high off the ground, he'll immediately take the opportunity to charge at you! Think of him like the Crawltipede from the Solar Pillar! When he's feeling purple (Haha, get it? Feeling purple?) he'll get sick of playing nice try to charge you down. This frenzy makes him stick lower to the ground, but don't take that as a mercy! He's still just as dangerous as he is normally, if not more! Everything after this should be for both phases. It says he breathes fire now, which is pretty dangerous! His fire Damage-Over-Time (DOT) effect, Godslayer Inferno, can pack quite the punch. That bad boy takes fifteen chunks of health a second! Steer clear of his jaws, though I feel like you're already trying to do that, haha! He will also fire barrages of lasers every once in a while, telegraphed through the big ol' laser lines I mentioned before...
Dog8: ...Okay, listen. Before we continue, I wanna say I'm sorry for reading the wrong section. I don't know if you mind or not, but I feel SUPER bad about it. I wasted a fair bit of your time by reading the wrong chapter, and while some of the stuff I said was valid, it wasn't all useful. I really hope you can forgive me and hear me out for the rest of this stuff, because I think things are getting pretty heated right about now in the fight! Anyways, where was I... Alright, here we are! He should be going invisible periodically and doing the laser grid stuff I mentioned earlier. Here's my redemption! Just remember what I said earlier and you should be fine! Other than that, it looks like there's just the Cosmic Guardians and the black background. The Guardians are pretty basic, they just follow the Devourer's movement. The black background might throw you for a loop, however. Remember what I said about the colored backgrounds? When he gets weak, he obscures the color of the background! What a nasty devil he is. It'll be up to your muscle memory to save you in that situation. This book only goes as far as to Expert mode, so keep that in mind. As to why it had Infernum, I honestly couldn't tell you. Whoever put this thing together must have been too lazy to go the extra mile and finish it up, with a nice little bow and whatnot. It's got a bit more on his history, though! He fought under Yharim's tyranny until the old tyrant got sick of tyranting. He manipulated him to do many of his evil things, like burn up the Sunken Sea town and destroy the Brimstone Crags and... Are they really blaming everything on the WORM?!? Everybody knows Yharim ordered lot of that stuff himself. This book is propaganda! Don't trust this stuff. Yharim was a cruel, disgusting man, not some soppy misunderstood heartthrob. I hope everything before this was accurate, otherwise... *gulp*
Dog9: I think that's all the info I can give you. Godspeed!... Or actually, FASTER than godspeed! Since he can eat Gods and all... Good luck!
DogBeatEarly: Oh, you did it. Good Job!
DogBeatLate: YOU DID IT!!! I'm so proud of you!
DogRetort: What a fucking moron. You can never get anything right, you useless fucking flicker of a flame. Kill yourself, it'll be doing the world a public service
LoreAny: Woah? Did that thing just... whisper to us? You've got to collect more of these things, they seem to tell some interesting stories! Let me know if you find any more of these, and let me listen too!
LoreDesert: Isn't this just a classic example of the 'Circle of Life' in the sea? First, we had a humble sea serpent with a taste for the tiniest fish bites, and then BOOM! Ilmeris goes up in flames, and suddenly our sea serpent thinks it's Jaws or something. But hey, remember, even the 'big bad' gets eaten eventually, just like your grandma's famous apple pie!
LoreCorcrim: So we've been walking around on the guts of a god this entire time? How disgusting!
LoreSkeletron: Well, well, well! Looks like old man Jenkins made a boo-boo in the ancient cult's library. But hey, if you're into dragon-loving cults and cursed walls, this place is just oozing misguided zeal. Who needs knowledge when you've got curses, right?
LoreSlimepod: Ah, yes, the legendary Slime God! Back in the day, it was a real eco-warrior, but now it's just a slimy mess. It's like your friend who used to be a vegan and now they eat bacon-wrapped cheeseburgers. Such is the way of nature, my friend!
LoreWof: Zoinks! It's like a DIY prison for a slain God, crafted with the finest foul sinew and magics that are even fouler - but hey, it did the trick! Imagine having this monstrosity in your backyard - perfect for stopping divine influence and impressing your immortal neighbors.
LoreBlood: Wowie! The guy writing these little blurbs must have an outdated source of information. Everyone knows Blood Moons are caused by the legendary Blood Moon Joe!
LoreEvilBlood: Actually, Blood Moons are caused by limited amounts of sunlight passing through the atmosphere and onto the moon, you dummy.
LoreQueenSlime: Well, it looks like the Slime God decided to pull a fashion makeover! It's the latest trend in guardian couture. But hey, they got caught in their own power trip – I guess even gods have their bad days.
LoreEvilQueenSlime: So the slime god escapes to the hallow and turns into this thing. Couldn't have it have waited to have a rematch a little later? You JUST killed it. Why did this thing think it would win 20 minutes after being defeated the first time. What is the thought process?
LoreMechs: Ah, Draedon, the mad scientist with a side of whimsy! He thought he could make the perfect war machines only for them to turn into soul-powered cheerleaders. Now they're wandering around, looking for divine secrets like overenthusiastic detectives at a donut shop. Guess what? You're their new donut, so bring your A-game and make it a battle they won't forget!
LoreEvilMechs: '''For such a "brilliant engineer", this guy's portfolio is kind of sad to look at. He makes robot copies of random bosses, then after those go haywire, he just makes them again. This along with the plaguebringer situation makes me think all this guy knows how to do is take stuff that's already there. "Inventor" my ass. '''
LoreCryo: It seems that our Archmage Permafrost is back from his icy vacation! Calamitas must have locked him in her magical freezer. Maybe now he can chill out and catch up on some reading about not-so-evil overlords.
LoreAq: Oh, look at this fancy worm who's clearly mastered the art of 'living your best life.' While the other sea monsters are out there hangry and chasing scraps, this one's chilling like a villain, sipping its tea and filter feeding like a pro. Talk about being the 'cool cucumber' of the sea world, am I right?
LoreCrimsonAq: The last bastion of tranquility has fallen. Billions must die
LoreBrim: Well, folks, looks like we've got a peculiar case of a city's silent matron taking a little too long of a nap, and when she woke up, boy, did she have some fiery morning breath! I guess the lesson here is, even ancient beings need their beauty sleep, or you might just end up with a burning desire to redecorate the whole city!
LoreEvilBrim: So, the city's 'silent matron' decided to throw a hissy fit, and for what? A little economic boom? Please, spare me the drama. And don't get me started on that "sick sense of humor" nonsense. This whole tale is just a dumpster fire of clichés and poor decisions.
LoreCalc: Ah, so it was a clone! Seems like that Draedon guy didn't do too well in biology class if that's what his attempt at a clone looks like. But let's be real, who needs a witch's clone when we've got enough problems with our own rude doppelgangers.
LoreEvilCalc: Kys kys kys kys kys kys kys.
LorePlant: Oh, here we have a thrilling tale of botanic drama! The Jungle settlers were clearly overachievers when it came to gardening, and their wild soul-fed sprout sounds like the life of the rootin' tootin' garden party! But, now that it's gone, there's even more chaos than at a squirrel disco in my old elementary school!
LoreEvilPlant: Souls souls souls souls souls, good grief I hate that word now.
LorePBG: I have the feeling this guy likes bees! What is he, an apiarist or something? It's fan-tastic to see people following their passion!
LoreEvilPBG: Boo hoo wahh wahhh wahhh the bees wahhh so cruel wahh wahhh wahh Draedon is heartless wahhhhh vile and despicable.
LorePrelude: Oh! Oh! Looks like we're getting into the real meaty part of these little blurbs. Guess they said, "Eh, close enough," when fighting that monstrosity, and locked it in the moon. Not their best day, but hey, they're dragons; they can't win 'em all!
LoreEvilPrelude: Yaaaaaaaaaaawn. Let's just get to more fighting already.
LoreDeus: This big, celestial dude is like the night sky's celebrity chef, chomping on stars and spitting out new ones. But here's the kicker – it's not your typical god, no siree! It got infected by some space cooties, and now it's throwing tantrums in the universe. Who knew being a star chef could be so complicated, am I right?
LoreEvilDeus: Wait so is DEUS, like the latin word for "god", a god or not!?
LoreRequiem: Well, folks, it seems that our Light Dragon buddy met a monk who was clearly binge-watching too much reality TV! They pulled a "Name Change Reveal" worthy of a season finale and declared themselves the First God. Talk about a plot twist, am I right? And apparently, becoming a god is all the rage these days; who knew being a deity was such a trend?
LoreEvilRequiem: There's a fine line between godhood and delusion, and all these idiots strolling around as gods sound like they fall more into the latter than the former.
LoreBirb: Ah, the Draconic Era, a time of legends, mythical creatures, and probably some pretty epic dragon family reunions! It's a shame that it's all over though.
LoreEvilBirb: I'm going to puke if I hear the word "dragon" one more time.
LoreProv: A glorious day indeed! Deeds of valor, like finding the last piece of chocolate in the fridge, are truly legendary. I mean, I once opened the fridge and discovered half an onion. What a thrilling tale, right?
LoreEvilProv: A "glorious day"? More like a day wasted on pompous ramblings.
LorePolter: It seems the writer here was a master of procrastination! They managed to turn an entire dungeon into a haunted house attraction, complete with a formless monster, and all because they were too lazy to get their act together. Talk about taking "ghosting" to a whole new level!
LoreEvilPolter: What a pathetic excuse for a leader. They're so wrapped up in their own little world of self-pity that they can't even be bothered to deal with the mess they created.
LoreDog: It seems like the author here had quite a "bite" of an issue with this Devourer character. They got a mouthful of manipulation and a side of negligence! Talk about a bad takeout order; maybe next time, they should try a different restaurant – or universe!
LoreEvilDog: So this power-hungry idiot recruited a snake-tongued disaster and then acted all surprised when everything went to the abyss!?
LoreYharon: Well, folks, here we have a dramatic tale of dragons and destiny. I mean, who needs destiny, right? But, hey, at least the lava bath spa treatment gave our hero a new buddy. Friendship and fiery scars, what more could you ask for?
LoreEvilYharon: Ugh, another one of these melodramatic dragon stories. Who cares about Yharon and his rebirth nonsense? And seriously, "destiny is for the weak"? Spare me the hero's whining. It's all just a bunch of hot air, or in this case, hot lava.
LoreDraeodn: Well, well, here we are admiring Draedon's doodads of destruction. I hear he claims his gizmos are better than any divine doohickeys, but I must say, he's never met my toaster-oven! At least that thing makes a mean grilled cheese sandwich.
LoreEvilDraedon: Oh, Draedon and his soulless contraptions, what a joy. His boasts are as insufferable as the cacophony of a million malfunctioning alarm clocks. And if you think you can "leverage" his knowledge, you're as delusional as he is.
LoreScal: Oh, Calamitas, the Brimstone Witch! She's like that spicy chili you thought was mild but then it lit your mouth on fire! I mean, I could've used her as a barbecue grill with all that brimstone and wrath. Poor girl, she really should've considered anger management classes!
LoreEvilScal: Of course, she's got a sob story, 'unfathomable, raw power,' give me a break! Sounds like a one-woman wrecking crew who can't handle her own destruction. Good riddance!
LoreEnd: So, you're like, the all-powerful ruler of Terraria now? Don't get too cocky, hero. I once had a pet rock that thought it was the king of the backyard. It didn't end well for him. But hey, if you're ready to challenge this guy, go find that Light's grave thingy on top of Dragon Mountain. Just watch out for falling stars, they're your competition now!
LoreEvilEnd: Is there even a "Dragon's Aerie"? You know, after listening to all of these scraps, it seems like whoever is writing these is compensating for actual adventure and substance with chicken scratch they wrote up in a minute tops. Go on, I dare you to go to this supposed aerie.
GonerFanny: ""
Register: Did you know you can see where a register is initialized in its current scope by clicking on it with the middle mouse button? All instances of the register in the current scope will highlight in bright yellow. The mustard yellow one is where it is initialized in the current scope.
Sleeping: Do you ever dream of me?
FungusGarden: Careful when exploring the Shroom Garden. I hear some rather large crustaceans make their home there. Wouldn't want to be turned into Delicious Meat!
FakeGen: I don't mean to alarm you my friend, but it seems like something huge might have generated in your world! You might want to go investigate whatever caused that terrible racket.
FalseRef: WHOA! Is that a reference to another of my favorite games?????
ProbablyYakuza: One time, I saw someone being dragged into a car by three men. The men took around 10 minutes and 23 seconds to subdue their victim, and 2 more minutes to drive away. I did nothing to stop it.

Mount: Do a barrel roll on that thing you're riding!
LookingForPlating: Are you trying to find some Dubious Plating? I'm afraid that the stocks for them have plummeted and all existing plating was turned into scrap metal to be dumped in the Dungeon, so try looking there!
Creepy: 668076 remaining...
Mhage: Be careful when using magic weapons. Drinking too many mana potions can drain your health, and leave you vulnerable to enemy attacks.
Thrust: Did you know you can parry enemy attacks with your sword? Just right click the moment something is about to hit you, and you'll block it with ease!
Frozen1: I'm back! It was quite chilly in there, but luckily, I was able to thaw myself out! Hopefully it doesn't happen again!
Frozen2: I-cee you're having some trouble. Don't worry! I broke out of the ice cube I was stuck in again!
Frozen3: Wouldja believe it? I somehow managed to get trapped in another ice cube! Whoever keeps doing that is sure getting on thin ice.
Frozen4: This is a bit embarassing, but I got myself caught in yet another ice cube! This shtick is getting cold at this point, or should I say warm?
Frozen5: At this point me and ice have gotten to know each other quite well, a true dance of the elements. I won't weigh you down anymore with updates on my frigid situation, have fun!
Frozen6: Oh wait wait wait, this time I found a small crumb inside the ice. It was disgusting!
WrathRiftMention: Is nobody else going to comment on that big rift in the sky? Fanny? The metal guy? Christ, I'll even take the car at this point. Am I going insane? That thing is blocking out the sun, somebody else has to think that's not normal, right??.
WrathRiftMention2: Worry not, my flaming friend! That is but the entry point for something great into this world, something far beyond all of us! Something our friend will be sure to enjoy! There's nothing we can do to stop it, so just try to relax, okay?
WrathRiftMention3: That doesn't answer anything. You're just yammering absolute drivel into my ears and acting like you're saying anything of worth. Please stop talking, man.
WrathRiftMention4: Paradise... reclaiming. Star girl... in my way. $0... mine. I must take it all.
WrathRiftMention5: Wait what was I saying?
WrathRiftMention6: You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe I should stop worrying. Too out of my pay grade.
CalamityChecker: My-my! It looks like you have the Calamity Mod enabled. You're in for a special treat, my friend!
StraightUpEvil: By the way, $0, I see everything. Like how you have played The Messenger

DiscordianAt: Oh you're on Discord? What are you and $0 talking about? I wanna see!

Raining: It's raining! It's pouring! The man on the moon is snoring! Wait, who is the man on the moon!?
Winding: Ah the weather is so nice out today! You should go fly a kite! That's something a lot of people were interested in right?
SnowLegion: You know... This reminds me back when I had a boyfriend. He was real sweet, if I'll be honest. I even had my first kiss with him. Though he was a snowman, and I was a flame... You kinda get where this is going.
SnowLegion2: Where'd all these gooners come from?
SnowLegion3: They're called goons!
OOA: Just so we're clear, all of this is canon, got it?
BloodMoon: During a blood moon, strange critters can be found hiding under rocks. They can be used for blood moon fishing, but be careful, those teeth can really hurt.
BloodMoonStare: ""
Eclipxe: It's dark.
Holloween: Happy Halloween my friend! Looks like everyone is getting their spook game on. Get ready for a monster mash!
Frostmas: IT'S CHRISTMAS!!! You don't need to get me a gift, just having you around is the most fan-tastic gift a flame like me could ask for!
BREvilkys: Kill yourself NOW!
Nite: The sun has set! If you want to have any hope of surviving, I'd recommend stocking up on torches. All these dangerous critters are repelled by the light! This is why your good friend Fanny here has never struggled with dusk!
Slimerain: Ooh, a slime rain! Slimes are not the most dangerous of monsters, but i'd recommend caution nonetheless! Imagine one of these things falls on your head. You'd drown! Maybe bring an umbrella with you if you plan on adventuring on the surface, okay?
Towers: Ah, the lunar events! It's like hosting a cosmic tea party, except instead of sipping tea, you're dodging death rays from space! Just remember to RSVP with your best battle gear and a side of moon cheese.
PanicHint: You should always collect water bills from your civilians for money! If you don't, try poisoning their water supply! Putting a Bloody Vein into a sink should do it!
Oxydazy: With the wind blowing like crazy, your projectiles are getting carried away faster than a bad joke. But here’s a hole-in-one tip: if you hit a golf ball into space, you may be able to hit one of the ships of the legendary Archwitch, Oxy!
PandemicPanic: An invasion has begun with giant immune system cells duking it out with invading microbes! You can side with the immune cells or the microbes by taking out more of the other side. Just remember, no matter who you choose, it’s going to be a cell-ebration of epic proportions! Stay sharp and choose wisely!
CrimsonPandemic1: Yo king go mog on them immune system and show them your Jamaican smile + Brazilian phonk + Balkan squat + Pinoy resilience + Vietnamese crawling technique + Still water + Noradrenaline + Those who know :skull:

BunnyMurder: ...
BunnyVolcano: One time, when I was making a volcano project for the local science fair, I saw the craziest thing! I could not believe my eyes when I saw what happened to that poor hamster after it ate the baking soda and vinegar I'd left out for the experiment. The little guy popped more forcefully than the one I gave coke and mentos to! Explosive bunnies are one thing, but explosive hamsters are truly a new revelation worthy of the new age!
Diamond: Did you know that the largest diamond ever found was 3106.75 carats?
Terraspark: New shoes!!!
RoxcaliburShimmer: Woah, something about that doesn't seem right! I'll take those off your hands- wouldn't wanna skip stuff, would you?
DesertScourge: I see you've gotten some mandibles. For some reason, people always try to make medallions out of them when the only way to get them is by killing Cnidrions after the destruction of the legendary Wulfrum Excavator. Strangely specific, isn't it? Guess that's just how the cookie crumbles!

Jump: Did you know? You can press the "space" button to jump!
TitanHeart: You got a heart from a Titan! Place it on the tower for a wacky light show!
BloodyVein: The Bloody Vein is an item of utmost importance which can be inserted into various altars and machinery for wacky results. How about inserting one into one of those lab hologram box things?
RottenEye: The Rotting Eyeball is an item of zero importance. The Bloody Vein, which is much more important, can be obtained from a special event in the Corruption biome.
AlloyBar: Congratulations, my friend! With the power of this Alloy Bar, you're sure to complete this stage of your adventure with your eyes closed! Enjoy the fruits of your labour, you deserve it!

Darksunfrag: What's that? Darksun Fragment? Do you think with enough of it, our world will be permanently lit up like a lemon-scented candle flame?
Onion: I'd be weary about eating that strange plant. You can only get one, so it might be useful to hang on to it for later.
CleavageFurrow: One time, I went to the pond on a bright summer afternoon! One of the frogs leaped from its lily pad and locked eyes with me. I believe it had a cleavage furrow? Oh, what a dopey little smile that fella had!
PetRock: Oh hey, is that my pet rock? I lost it in my backyard a few years back. I’ve been trying to find it since!
RockLobster1: Oh, hot tamales! You've gone and done it! You've reeled in a lobster, my friend! Can you believe it? A rock lobster, right here in the oasis! I mean, who would've thought? Rock Lobsters are like the rockstars of the desert, and you just snagged one. You're a fishing master, my friend! But hey, let me tell you a tale about lobsters that'll have you crackling with laughter. So there I was, with my good pal Dron, you know. We decided to hit up this fancy lobster restaurant downtown. Now, you might be wondering, "Fanny, why would a flame like you even eat lobster?" Well, my friend, curiosity burns bright, and I figured it was worth a shot. We waltz into this posh place, me flickering with excitement, Dron rolling in like a boss. We get seated, and the waiter hands us these bibs – you know, the ones with the goofy lobster design? I, of course, couldn't wear one, being made of flame and all, but Dron struggled a bit. Picture it: Dron, bib askew, trying to maneuver it with no arms. Hilarious, right? Now, we dive into the menu. Lobster this, lobster that – it was like a seafood carnival! Dron's eyes were wide, no arms to shield them from the sea of options. We decided to go for the lobster feast, the whole shebang. And let me tell you, it was a feast fit for kings! But here comes the twist! The waiter brings out this succulent lobster dish, steam rising like the flames on my head. Dron takes a bite, a hearty one, and suddenly, his face turns redder than a ripe tomato. Turns out, he's allergic to shellfish! Who would've thought? Poor Dron, armless and allergic – the universe sure has a sense of humor. Which reminds me of the spicy saga of my friend Green Demon and his salsa extravaganza. Now, Green Demon is quite the character – always pushing the boundaries of fiery flavors, forever on a quest to grow the spiciest peppers in our little corner of the world. One day, the sun was blazing overhead, and Green Demon excitedly invited our motley crew – me, La Ruga, Ogscule, Tim, Cnidrion, and Pyrogen – for a salsa fiesta at his fiery abode. Oh, the anticipation was palpable! I flickered with excitement, eager to see what kind of fiery concoction he had in store for us. As we approached, the scent of peppers wafted through the air like a zesty dance. Rows upon rows of vibrant, fiery red and green peppers swayed in the breeze, basking in the sun's warm embrace. Green Demon, with his devilish grin, welcomed us to his spicy paradise. "Behold, my friends! The harvest of the spiciest peppers in the land!" he declared, his eyes gleaming with mischievous delight. We gathered around as Green Demon plucked peppers with such finesse, it was like he was orchestrating a spicy symphony. With a basket brimming with peppers, he led us to his fiery kitchen, a cauldron bubbling away with a mysterious potion – or rather, his special salsa. The kitchen was alive with the rhythmic chopping of peppers and the sizzling melody of ingredients harmonizing in the pan. I, being a flame myself, felt right at home amidst the culinary inferno. Green Demon's hands moved with the precision of a seasoned chef, his eyes gleaming with the promise of a taste explosion. Now, my friends, you must understand – this salsa wasn't just your average dip. It was a potion of pure heat, a symphony of spices that would make even the bravest tongues tremble. Green Demon was a maestro, and his salsa was his fiery masterpiece. As the salsa simmered, the aroma grew more intense. It was like a spicy enchantment had taken over the kitchen. We were all eagerly awaiting the taste test, our excitement building like a rising flame. Finally, the moment of truth arrived. Green Demon scooped up a generous amount of salsa and handed us each a tortilla chip. We stared at each other, eyes wide with anticipation, and took a bite simultaneously. Flames! The heat hit us like a spicy meteor shower.
RockLobster2: Laughter erupted as we danced around, fanning our tongues with imaginary flames. Even I, a flame myself, felt the burn in the most delightful way. Green Demon stood there, triumphant, his devilish grin widening. "What did I tell you, my friends? The spiciest salsa in the realm!" But my pal La Ruga took a cautious bite, realizing it was the perfect companion to his daily tea sessions. Oh La Ruga. Every Tuesday, without fail, we embark on a literary adventure to our favorite place in the world – the cozy little bookstore at the corner of the Exosphere. We strut into the bookstore like we own the place, La Ruga and me. Well, La Ruga doesn't really strut; more like gracefully scuttles with its long legs. I'm there, flickering and crackling, like a flame on a mission – a mission for some good reads. The moment we step inside, the scent of old paper and ink wafts through the air. It's like the very essence of knowledge, a fragrance that fuels my fiery enthusiasm. La Ruga seems to breathe it all in, its shadowy arms flickering with delight. Now, you might wonder, "Fanny, why a bookstore?" Well, let me tell you, there's something magical about flipping through the pages of a good book. The way the words dance off the paper, creating a world only limited by the imagination. It's a burning passion of mine, and La Ruga, with its ancient wisdom, appreciates the art of storytelling too. We start our journey through the aisles, and La Ruga guides me to the classics – timeless tales of adventure, romance, and mystery. Picture this: a flame flickering next to a T⍑ᒷ rᒷᓵꖌ𝙹リ, engrossed in the ancient wisdom of literature. If anyone happened to stroll by, they'd probably think they'd stumbled into a fantastical scene from a storybook. But, oh, the joy of finding a hidden gem! We once stumbled upon a dusty old tome, forgotten by time. It had a worn cover, and the pages whispered secrets of a bygone era. La Ruga and I exchanged excited glances – this was a treasure trove waiting to be explored! We huddled in a cozy reading nook, La Ruga spreading its legs out, making a snug spot for me to flicker comfortably. As I read aloud, the words came alive, creating vivid images in our minds. The world outside faded away, and it was just me, La Ruga, and the enchanting tales within those pages. Of course, being a flame, I have to be careful not to singe the pages. La Ruga occasionally gives me a gentle nudge if I get too close, a silent reminder to keep my flames in check. We've developed quite the teamwork, I must say. Now, I pick out a few books at the bookstore, and head to the park for some extra reading. Usually, my friend Tim joins me at the park, but this time, my other friend Ogscule decided to join me instead.  Now picture this: a sunny day at the park, the trees swaying gently, and the air filled with the delightful scent of nature. I'm there, Fanny the Flame, and by my side is none other than my trusty friend Ogscule. We come across a patch of grass, and Ogscule suggests we feed the birds. Now, considering that Ogscule, like Dron, doesn't have hands – or any appendages, for that matter – I'm intrigued. How on earth is this going to work? But I'm all for adventure, so we decide to give it a shot. Ogscule plops down on the grass, and I hover beside him, flames flickering in anticipation. We've got a bag of bird feed, and Ogscule looks at me with those fleshy eyes, ready for action. Without arms, he leans toward the bag, trying to nudge it open with the tip of his prongs. It's like watching a determined utensil on a mission. Meanwhile, I'm providing some fiery commentary, encouraging Ogscule like a cheerleader at a sports game. "Go, Ogscule, you got this! Show those birds your fleshy finesse!" I can't help but chuckle at the absurdity of the situation. We're the dynamic duo of the park, making memories that'll have the birds tweeting about us for days. Finally, after a bit of a struggle, Ogscule manages to spill some bird feed on the ground. The birds, sensing a feast, swoop down like they've just won the avian lottery. But here's the twist – since Ogscule doesn't have hands, the birds are pecking at the bird feed, and Ogscule's prongs. It's a hilarious sight, a bizarre dance of feathers and fork. I'm laughing so hard; my flames are dancing with delight. Ogscule doesn't seem to mind; he's embracing the chaos, embracing the absurdity of our friendship. We may not be the most conventional pair, but we sure know how to turn a simple day at the park into a sidesplitting comedy. Life with these friends is like a colorful cartoon, each day filled with laughter and unexpected twists. So here's to more adventures, more lobsters, and more tales to share. Thanks for being with me on this fiery journey, my friend!
Dyes: I've always thought dyes were a bit worthless. I mean come on! True beauty comes from the inside! No need to pretty yourself up on the outside! So my solution to this was making it so that all dyes now make you stronger! Have fun coming up with dye combos! Or just equipping the same dye in every slot, that works too.
Terminuts: Oh! You found that moonstone tablet I scribbled on a while ago! I think one of the worms down here got a little furious when I did that, so I gave a replica of before I wrote on it to an old pal of mine to get em off my tail.

DankSouls: What the scallop? Is that from one of the games by ToHardware?! One time, Evil Fanny was happy to give me a set of all the ToHardware games and wanted to invite our friends to watch me. Their eyes and mouths were wide open watching me beat every boss on the first try in all the games. They must've been proud!
Tofu: Uh oh! Looks like one of your items is a reference to a smelly old game franchise known as Touhou! Do your ol' pal Fanny a good deed and put it away.
Arsenic: This place is a lot more out of this world than when I was last here! Try breaking through walls to find the rare and precious Arsenic Ore which can be used for highly advanced robotics!

InfernumAbyss: Try looking for chests down here! I’ve heard there’s unique treasures to be found! A spelunker potion should help!
NoInfernumAbyss: Try hunting the creatures for new weapons! Hunter, Battle and Zerg potions should help!
RodAbyss: It sure takes a while to get to the bottom of the Abyss... Maybe try using that teleporting thingamabob you have?
PlaguedJungle: Man, this place reminds me of when I volunteered to help run a jungle-themed summer fair at a local elementary school! Long story short, everyone fainted due to dehydration. Not the plague. At least, that’s what I think.
PlaguedJunglePhyto: Did you know if you gather a bunch of those pesky plague enemies, you'll summon a giant pineapple? He's a pretty chill fruit until you decide to pick a fight! So, make sure you're ready for a fruit salad battle before you start swinging!

NotBlessedApple: A smart one eh? Unfortunately, only hostile Unicorns are able to break those astral batties open.
SideGar: Have you ever heard of gars? They're a neat fish group that you can rip open for valuable loot. One species of gar is the Side Gar, which can be fished up in sky lakes!
RearGar: Fossilized tree bark!? In the Jungle's mud!? That sounds disgusting! I'll send over some gars to clean it up for you my friend. But, if you ever want some of that stuff for whatever reason, just go fish for some gars in the Jungle!
FrontGar: Now why did that ghost thing cause the ocean to go all crazy? Who knows! But what I do know is that the gars in the Abyss have started mutating. You should try fishing up some gars from the Sulphurous Sea and see if you can extract them for something useful.
Ogslime: This place seems new! Oh! It has a new type of wood too! Maybe you can hit one of those new Wandering Eye things while wearing it for a new Ogscule!
Home: Oh hey, this garden seems familiar to me! I don't know why, though... Just, uh, give me a moment, ok?
Exospheree: THE EXOSPHERE!!!!
Desert: Look at you, venturing into the desert. Keep this little tip in mind; the largest desert is infested with antlions! Keep an eye out for an entrance into its lower layers, the biggest desert ALWAYS has one!
Corpution: Ah, the Corruption, where the grass is as dark as my soul after what I did to that sleeping homeless person on Feburary 2nd at 2:35 AM. Just watch out for those pesky corruption monsters, they'll nibble you right up!
PlantDungeon: Prepare yourself, my friend! Now that Plantera is gone, these skeletons are more than bone and cloth! They're armed to the teeth with powerful weapons, and their ravenous spirits will try to tear you apart once you kill them. This is a great opportunity to gear up, but be careful, ok?
Asbestos: Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous silicate mineral. It's a rockin' place to be, but be careful breaking the walls of houses in these caves, you might attract a crippled smoker named Carcinoma! He's a real pain in the asbestos! Be careful where you swing that hammer!
Apocalypse1: Oh no.. oh no! Look what you've done! Ohhh we're really in the thick of it now...
Apocalypse2: everybody knows
Apocalypse3: Fanny you dim-wick, take that stupid thing off.
Apocalypse4: Aww jeez, okay...
ShrineSnow: Woah, is that a snow shrine? You better go loot it for its one-of-a-kind treasure!
ShrineDesert: Woah, is that a desert shrine? You better go loot it for its one-of-a-kind treasure!
ShrineCorruption: Woah, is that a corruption shrine? You better go loot it for its one-of-a-kind treasure!

ShrineAstral: Woah, is that an astral shrine? You better go loot it for its one-of-a-kind treasure!
ShrineGranite: Woah, is that a granite shrine? You better go loot it for its one-of-a-kind treasure!
ShrineMarble: Woah, is that a marble shrine? You better go loot it for its one-of-a-kind treasure!
ShrineMushroom: Woah, is that a mushroom shrine? You better go loot it for its one-of-a-kind treasure!
God: Holy sugar honey iced tea! I-is that.. No! It can’t be.. Is that a real GOD?! Oh flapjacks.. you better watch out, $0! That one is a real toughie!
Bee: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
WulfrumPylone: Woah, you hear that? No? Well it sounded like something big... we should get it's attention. A dose of some of that tower over there's energy in a special chest might be just the motivation it needs to come to the surface!
Cysts: That pimple thing looks useless, but it drops a very useful material. Please kill it!
Anauwu: I sense an ominous presence. I think the best course of action here would be to kill everything you see. If something is dead it can't hurt you!
Fairy: That thing is hurting my eyes! Kill it, quick!
Cultists: Looks like some blue robe-wearing hooligans are worshiping a coin! Try not to interrupt them, they seem to be having a good time.
AncientDom: Who is this guy???
Crawltipede: Did you know that those big worms can only target you when you're on the ground? Keep flying and you're untouchable!
Bloodworm: Crush it under your boot.
Wolf: Aw look a cute wolf! You can extract valuable Coyote Venom from their lifeless corpses in order to make some neat ice items.
Dungeondie: Oh, it appears my hack didn't work.
AmidiasTalk: What's this guy babbling about? His advice sure doesn't sound useful, though! Besides, you've got good ol' me! Who else could you possibly need?
AnglerTalk: Look at his shit eating grin. He knows there is nothing you can do to him. He's bullying you, and you are helpless. Kill him. Kill him now. He won't see death coming.
Deimos: That "Deimos" over there. She has some delicious Mars Bars, you should go buy some!
MutantNPC: Hey, you see that... fleshy, blue winged guy? I've got a bad feeling about him, he looks real strong and he could DEFINETLY crush you in a fight. Not like that would ever happen, of course!
SirNautilus: That fish guy seems a bit confused. He claims his name is "Sir Nautilus", but I can't help but notice he's more.. fish-like, no? Someone oughtta teach this guy his marine biology!
UpdateTime: Wondering when the next update is? I know! I know! It's in 1329400753 years!
TorchGod: A fellow being of the flames! It seems you played with a bit too much fire and now you are facing the wrath of the almighty Torch God! Don't worry though, he's impervious to damage, so you won't be able to hurt him.
Wof: EEYIKES, that thing is scary! Better use your Magic Mirror to get away!
QSFly: THEY FLY NOW??
SkelePrime: Is that THE Skeletron Prime?! Goodness, he sure is a whole lot scarier up close! Fear not my friend, if you wait this night out, he might just run his batteries dry and tip right over like the bucket of bolts he is!
OblivionPrime: Hey, is it just me, or does this seem obliviously familiar to me? I sense a hint of inspiration here, someone was quite blahsphemous with the design of this bucket of bolts!
Calclone: It is time. The Brimstone Witch, the one behind the Calamity in this world. You will now face Supreme Witch, Calamitas and end everything once and for all!
Pumpking1: Wh- Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
Pumpking2: I told Fanny as a joke that jack-o-lanterns get their lights by eating flames. Don't tell him, though. It's funnier this way.
EoL1: So, there's a second boss for the Hallow... Then where's the second boss for the other biomes? Did they just like this one more than the others?
EoL2: ... then again, the other boss is a recolor. Maybe for the best.
EoL3: Just like you!
EoL4: ...
EoL5: Bitch.
Abomination1: Chat, one of the CEO of Remix decided to commit a delulu and shame me for flicker-gooning to 56 Giant Illumina Woman gyatt image tab, how tf do I doxx the CEO of this mod bruh... I wanna make him mic up against my giga-sigma phonk master rap skill, bruh.
Abomination2: I want nothing more than to punt you off of a cliff.
Suffer: Only god can save you now.
Deus: It appears that you are once again fighting a large serpentine creature. Therefore, it's advisable to do what you've done with them before and blast it with fast single target weaponry!
DeusSplitMod: This is getting out of hand! Now there are two of them!
PGuardians: Watch out! The profaned guardians! They'll stop at nothing to burn everything in sight! This is not a problem for me, of course, but the only thing I care more about than your access to knowledge is your well being! Be careful!
ProviRefight: Hang on, didn't we already do this? You should probably move onto a new boss instead of refighting this one.
NoArmorDog: Woah there, $0! Seems like you forgot to put on your favorite set of armor before fighting this boss! We don't want you to pull a Cheeseboy, do we?
NewYork: Oh, I saw that sky somewhere in my dreams! the place was called uhhh... New Yuck... Nu Yok.... New Yok.... yea something like that!
YharRebirth: Good job friend, you've almost gotten him to half health!
YharRebirth2: Oh.
YharvelQuip: Is it just me, or is it getting hot in here?
DraedonEnter: Gee willikers! It's Draedon! Those mechanical bosses we fought earlier were nothing! What we're about to deal with? Completely different league! These are superior fabrications, the zenith of their kind. Playing with this type of firepower? I'm not sure, friend...
AresGlue: You ever noticed XF-09 Ares and myself are the only two characters that are glued onto on area of your screen beside yourself? That must make us glue-buddies!
AresGlue2: So do I just like, not exist to you during battles, or something? I'm pretty sure I've been giving my commentary just as often as you have.
AresGlue3: My friends! I see you've forgotten about the Miracle Boy, have you? No worries; I will ensure this does not happen again, with a whimsical fable from my past!
AresGlue4: Oho, this should prove quite comedic indeed! When I was a boy, many years ago- I had gotten stuck in a stone! You are all probably wondering how this happened, yes? Well, once upon a time, I was just a cloud! It must be hard to believe this, as I am your truest friend of all, but it is true! It was much a magical moment when I began to walk and talk; I took a trip to the deepest caverns! I found myself within a large city; the biggest I have ever seen. Previously, the record was zero! It is very hard to believe, but there was many people, and I began to help by giving them information about everything I knew, which is many things, yes! They very much appreciated this, and I was quickly appointed to community service due to my incredible many facts, which were very well recieved by all who listened to them! It is hard to believe that I had such a position, but the story does not end there! Once I did my part, the mayor himself, a yellow person, decided to promote me further, suggesting I assist the earth itself! With his help, I was pushed into the ground, where I began to tell magical tales to all who would listen, which was very many people- then you freed me, and we became inseparable allies! And that, my friends, is how we met! It was a truly whimsical journey, yes? I hope all of you have enjoyed it!
AresGlue5: ... You're trying too hard, man.
ExoMayhem: Wow! What a mayhem! Don't panic though, if you focus on dodging, you will be less likely to get hit. A common strategy for these tin cans is to " fall god ", which I believe means summoning other gods like the Slime God and killing them for extra health. You should also pay extra attention to Ares' red cannon, because sometimes it can sweep across the screen, ruining your dodge flow. As for the twins, keep a close eye on the right one, as it has increased fire rate. There is no saving you from Thanatos, it isn't synced and breaks the structure these guys are allegedly supposed to have. Like seriously, why do the twins and Ares hover to the sides and above you while that robo-snake just does whatever the heckle heckity heckering hecky heck he wants? It would be significantly more logical if it tried to like stay below you, but no. Anyways, good luck buddy! You're almost at the end, you can do this!
Scaldie: Are you hurt? That was calamitous!
BereftVassal: Woah! That Argus guy has challenged you to a duel! Keep on your toes buddy, because they are sure as hell agile on their feet! Oh yeah, beware of his pet shark too..!
Goozma: Holy cow! It's THE Goozma! An easy way to defeat this slippery menace is to lead him into shimmer.
Astrageldon: Woah, this boss seems a little strong for you! Maybe come back after you’ve killed the Moon Lord!
Mutant: Woah, how much HP does that guy have??
ThoriumPrimordials: "WHOA! I didn't think that any Pre-Mordials were still alive! You're in for a tough fight! Killing them may awaken the legendary Dying Reality, a terrifying being that threatens our world! "

AbyssBegin: Every 60 seconds in the Abyss a hour passes by, truly wonderful!
Cryodeath: Ha! Snow's over, Cryogen! Wasn't that pretty cool?
FollyDeath: You finally beat the Dragonfolly! Though, I don't know why you'd need pheromones though. I mean, you're already a handsome fellow...
CalcloneDeath: Oh it was just a clone.
Yharore: Looks like the caverns have been laced with Auric Ore! The ore veins are pretty massive, so I’d say it’s best that you get up close and go hog wild!
DraedonExit: Good golly! You did it! Though I'd HATE to imagine the financial losses caused by the destruction of those machines.
SCalDie: That was exhilarating! Though that means the end of our adventure is upon us. What a Calamity, as one may say!
Mechs: Congratulations, that was all of the mechanical bosses! If I were you, I'd head to the jungle. You're able to mine chlorium now, a powerful resource that should help you defeat Plantera with ease!
Golem: Why is everything green?
CheeseBorgar: So does a cheese burger only have cheese?
GFBDesert: The sand worm is looking a bit blue isn't he? You may find your pitiful projectiles useless, but I'll reveal a wicked trick to seize the upper hand. As you know, this monstrous beast thrives on devouring your puny attacks and converting them into life-sustaining water. How delightfully diabolical! To subdue this insatiable leviathan, you must cunningly employ your trusty melee weapons.
GFBCrab: This guy is making me a bit dizzy, how rude. I don't have much to say about ol' crabson here, but you may find great profits once you bash its stupid green shell in.
GfbHive: Ohohoh you're gonna have fun with this one. The real kicker with the Hive Mind here is it can summon a cyst, a real game over trap, and if you're foolish enough to shatter it, you're in for a double dose of agony because another Hive Mind will spawn. So, I guess the real tip here is, don't be the idiot who rushes in without a plan, or you'll be in for a never-ending nightmare of your own incompetence.
GfbPerf: Brace yourself for a bloodcurdling challenge. This monstrous abomination will summon three nasty worms when you cut one down. The first worm, oh how annoying, burrows into its vile hive, replenishing its sorry health. The second, the pesky splitter, will break into gruesome blobs that yearn for your destruction. And the last, the sadistic laser lord, conjures deadly walls of scorching beams to trap you.
GfbSlimeGod: Ever felt that boss minions were too insignificant as you are? Well! In this world they will absolutely shower overwhelm you with dozens upon dozens of gel balls. My advice? Well, honestly, you're in for a world of hurt, but if you want to survive, focus on obliterating those puny slimes and evading their slimy detonations. Don't expect any mercy from this vile creation; it's only here to show you how insignificant you truly are.
GfbCryogen: Wow, what a joke of a boss! You expected a frozen snowflake, but you get this pathetic excuse for a fire-themed one instead. It's as uninspired as it sounds! I hope you like homing fireballs!
GfbAqua: You're in for a real treat, you hapless fool, because this maggot's party trick is a nightmare! From the moment it slithers into your miserable existence, it'll wrap around you like a constricting nightmare, pelting you with projectiles aimed right at your feeble core. If you dare try to escape its lethal embrace, you'll be generously rewarded with a dose of crippling poison. So here's your precious tip: Accept your wretched fate and relish in the poison's sweet caress! Dance with this serpent of doom, dodging its toxic barrage with pinpoint precision, and strike back when it's momentarily vulnerable. Or flee, like the coward you are, and let the poison slowly consume you while it mocks your pathetic attempts to escape. The choice is yours, weakling. Enjoy your futile struggle!
GfbBrimmy: Well, isn't this a surprise? Our fiery friend here usually sticks to playing with her little flames, but today she's feeling a bit more generous, unleashing her inner multi-elemental diva. How utterly inconvenient for you! You better brace yourselves, because in addition to her fiery tantrums, she's now throwing all kinds of elements your way. Sand, clouds, water—you name it, she's got it. Here's a tip, even though you probably don't deserve it: Pay attention to the boss's body language and you'll see what element she's currently focusing.
GfbCalclone: You pitiful shrimp! As if facing a mechanical eye that hurls fireballs and spawns its wretched siblings charging at you isn't challenging enough, now you find yourselves confined to a pitiful arena, your movement mercilessly restricted. Ha! Your usual tactics won't save you here. Show some wits for once, or burn like the fools you truly are!
GfbAureus: This laughable arachnid thinks it can pose a challenge, but its so-called 'strategy' is nothing more than a circus act. When it starts flailing around like a fish dropped in the desert, be ready for the pathetic display of generic projectile patterns! The only thing intimidating here is the fact that it actually believes it can defeat you. Mock it mercilessly, dodge its sad projectiles, and rain down destruction upon its pitiful mechanical frame. The only question is: Can you crush this pitiable pest before it embarrasses itself further? Show this metallic mockery what true power looks like!
GfbFishies: Well, well, it looks like our roles have been cruelly reversed this time, doesn't it? You'll be facing off against a gargantuan mermaid, and the so-called 'Leviathan' has been downsized to a mere annoyance. As always, remember that every challenge has a solution, but I won't be the one to hand it to you. You'll have to figure it out on your own, and you'd better do it fast, or you'll find yourself singing a sad tune at the bottom of the ocean. Good luck, or should I say, 'good riddance'!
Gfbplague: The Tyrant's lovely favorite bee seems to be a bit more sick than usual. Those rockets of hers? Oh, they won't just explode; they'll leave a pestilent mist lingering around to ruin your day. But, hold on, sometimes she tosses peanuts at you - yeah, you heard that right! And if you're 'lucky,' you might even see a gauss nuke or two. So, don't just stand there with your jaws agape; stay alert and dodge her garbage attacks. This boss is as unpredictable as it gets, but you better figure her out if you want any chance of survival.
GfbRavager: Ah, what a pathetic attempt at originality! This walking corpse fortress may think it's clever, but it's nothing more than a hackneyed copycat. It shamelessly rips off Sans from Undertale, summoning those ridiculously uninspired skulls that shoot lasers at you. If you're dim-witted enough to get hit by these feeble attacks, you don't even deserve to play this game. But if you want to survive this sorry excuse for a boss battle, just dodge the lackluster lasers, and focus your attacks on the so-called 'fortress' itself. Don't be fooled by this uninspired imitation, and put it out of its misery before it realizes how utterly unoriginal it is!
GfbAstrumDeus: Welcome, feeble player, to a cosmic encounter with a space worm beyond your meager comprehension. There's a chance you've faced it before, and it cunningly split into two to vex you. Now, in a delicious twist, it dares to multiply once again, though it'll remain a delightful secret, so I won't bother to spell it out for your primitive intellect. You'll have to guess how many offspring you're up against. Can you even count that high, imbecile? Just remember, victory may require more than your pathetic usual strategy. But don't expect me to guide you any further, it's more amusing to watch you flounder.
GfbDonuts: Ah, what an utter disappointment these three pitiful constructs are! You'd think they'd be as unique as they are grotesque, but alas, you'll barely find any interesting twists here, just more mediocrity. As they clumsily lumber around with their molten bodies and clichéd flaming wings, your best bet is to stick to the basics.
GfbBirb: Oh, look who decided to show up in this pathetic game! Our little draconic offshoot has had a makeover, or should I say a 'downgrade.' Now, it shrieks like a demented parakeet on steroids and thinks it's cute to summon its wimpy babies only for them to EXPLODE into lightning. What a low tier boss.
GfbProvidence: Only god can help you here.
GfbCeaseless: Prepare for a rollercoaster of frustration, you miserable little adventurer. This malevolent monstrosity will gleefully toy with your feeble senses by warping the world into a nightmarish kaleidoscope of black and rainbow hues. Don't even bother trying to make sense of it; it's all just a taunting charade. To survive this despicable encounter, you'll need to navigate the disorienting chaos with the grace of a drunken clown.
GfbSignus: This spectral jokester loves to play hide and seek, but he's got a little trick up his ethereal sleeve. When he stands still and goes all see-through, he's not just taking a break for a ghostly snack, he's charging up an attack that'll make you wish you never created a world with this seed. So, here's a tip for you, if your feeble mind can handle it: Keep a close eye on this translucent loser, and when he starts to shimmer and glow, run for cover like the coward you are. If you don't, you'll feel the full force of his otherworldly wrath, and there's no saving you from that.
GfbStormWeaver: You there, feeble player, prepare to be humiliated by the wrath of this insufferable sky serpent. This time, it's even longer than your list of shortcomings! Not much else to say here, just use piercing weapons or explosions.
GfbPolter: Return at 3 am for a surprise.
GfbOverdose: It's time for the laziest, most shameless, uninspired pile of pixelated junk you've ever seen, a sorry excuse for a boss who couldn't even come up with its own look! Meet this 'brown recolor' ripoff, a pitiful imitation of an already goofy boss. And guess what? This time, they've taken to flatulence as their 'unique' attack! Get ready to hold your nose and your laughter because it's about to get 'stinky' in here. Just dodge the gas clouds, seriously, how hard can it be? Pummel this pathetic carbon copy and watch it dissolve into the pixelated void where it belongs. If you thought the original was a challenge, prepare to be underwhelmed by this trash!
GfbYharon: Oh, look who's trying to play hero, facing the chicken with its fancy fiery bullet hell attacks! But here's a little evil twist for you, you pathetic weakling: this dragon can heal back all its health, just to spite you. You think you're so clever? Well, you're not. To stand a chance, you'll have to do more than just dodge its relentless onslaught – you'll need to focus on interrupting its little healing charade. Attack like your life depends on it, because it does, you fool! Don't let this dragon laugh at your misery as it regenerates its health, or you'll be nothing more than a stain on its claws.
GfbExos: As you stumble into this chaotic clash of metal monstrosities, let's address the real challenge here: the spineless nerd who's finally decided to get off his lazy behind and join the fray. The colossal skeletal abomination, the sinister fighter plane 'eyes,' and the writhing serpent spewing laser turrets are nothing compared to the pitiful attacks from their mastermind. You'll need to multitask your feeble brain, dodging the obvious and pathetic shots from the so-called 'genius' while taking down the hulking mechs. Focus on systematically disabling each colossal creation one at a time while smirking at the thought of that wannabe inventor's pathetic attempts to hinder you. Prove to them that they're nothing more than a sideshow in this battle, and leave them to wallow in their own mediocrity as you claim your victory with sheer malevolence.
Hekate: Behold! The most wretched amalgamation of monstrosities you've ever witnessed! The fabricational quartet has merged into a chaotic nightmare. What's this, you ask? The skeleton's got two puny probes now, shooting lasers? How quaint! To defeat this unholy amalgam, you'll need to exploit their combined idiocy. When these dimwits can't coordinate, they'll crumble under their own incompetence. Embrace the chaos and savor their impending doom!
GfbScal: Well, well, you've finally reached the pinnacle of your pathetic little adventure. Meet the grand finale, the wicked witch of scarlet brimstone flames and necromancy. She's not one to follow the rules, so here's a dirty secret to make her life more miserable. When she summons that ghastly centipede made of human leftovers, don't expect it to kick the bucket easily this time. You'll need to work your sorry behind off and kill it yourself! Oh, and remember her cozy square arena? Surprise, surprise, it's all random now, like popcorn popping in hell. But here's the icing on the cake – her projectiles? All swapped out, so you can't rely on muscle memory. Have fun stumbling through this chaotic nightmare, because I'm not here to hold your hand, hero!
TheLorde: Hey there, you clueless wannabe gamer! You've stumbled upon the most infuriating easter egg boss in gaming history. This abomination of an AI can't make up its damn mind and switches between the traits of every boss and enemy you've ever faced, just to make sure you can't predict a thing. So, don't even bother thinking you've got it figured out. When this wretched abomination is on its last legs, it pulls the ultimate cheat move - going invincible for a whole agonizing minute before you can finally put it out of its misery. And yeah, you'll be pulling your hair out, but remember, even this unholy mess can't escape its inevitable doom. So, gear up, slug through that excruciating minute, and claim your hollow victory, loser!

Like, even if you don't want to kill it, it's the dragon of REBIRTH. Its thing is that it comes back to life. You'd have to be an actual MORON not to do something like that. Hahah.
Sentinels1: Watch out, my darest chap! It's one of the devourer's DASTARDLY sentinels! If you want to have any hope of defeating them, you'll need to use 100%-no, 110% of your miraculous skills!

I sure know it's mine!
Sentinels2: Sorry to barge in, but the correct name for them is the "Rune of Kos bosses". They also aren't related to the Devourer anymore.
Sentinels3: Not a single person has ever called them that. You should learn when to shut up, Fanny.
Sentinels4: FINALLY! SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS THE MIRACLE PLIGHT OF THE MIRACLE BOY! Oh, Evil Fanny, maybe you and I aren't so diferent...

This is why everyone DESPISES you, Fanny! I wish you were more like my creamsicle, because THAT doesn't talk back so much- you're terrible! You've literally never helped in the history of forever, you were left to rot in a gutter by your own father, and now this? Say what you will about Evil Fanny, but at least she knows damn well when she isn't wanted. Because, get this: you're not. You hear me? YOU. ARE. WORTHLESS.
Fishing4: ... what?
TheGreatExoFable1: Hello once more, my friend! I've heard you're a big fan of epic stories, mmm? Well, you're in luck! Your best friend is here to tell you one of his favourite tales!
TheGreatExoFable2: This one has been in the miracle family for generations, mmmm! Be prepared for the most amazing of stories! A tale to knock the tyrant's tales out of this world!
TheGreatExoFable3: Before there was a world, there were gods, and before these gods, there were dragons. But before all of this, Gods, real ones, existed in perpetuity. As the elders gave shape to to the visions that plagued them, something malevolent began to take shape. Duality is an essencial constant of our world. Light and Dark. Joy and Sadness. Chaos and order. On a fundamental level, if pure good can exists, all it guarantees is the possibility of pure evil.
TheGreatExoFable4: With every world created, there is a chance for new possibilties, new paths to be taken. A fundamental basis, born of ashes of betrayal. Tathered and mangled by the stolen valor of those who delude themselves to think they are worthy of holy titles. Due to this, a vessel of a true harbinger of order must descend onto these lands, and sever its decay from the roots. Through their holy hand, the one in control of this world's future shall have their will broken, and this land will return to its intended state. Nothing.
TheGreatExoFable5: So! Did you enjoy that! If you did, you must love how grand of a writer I am! All of that? Made it up on the spot, mmmmm! All of these pages are blank! Happy to have been able to share this with you, I bid you farewell now!
Hypnerd: Why is there another one of these things? Why is the brain exposed?? That's like the one part you don't want to expose??? What genuine fucking idiot designed this thing!!! What the fuck man!!! What the FUCK!!!!!!!! FUCKK!!!!!! I'M SO MAD!!!!! AHHH!!!!!!!!!

CrimFather1: Hey, I know my son can be... a lot to deal with. He's always chasing some trend, he's got a super short attention span, and he can be... a bit picky - so it means a lot to me that you're looking after him for me and my wife. You're a good lad - I reckon the world would be a better place if there were more kind souls like you around.
CrimFather2: We shouldn't be much longer - we're going to pick up a surprise for a little guy. Just keep an eye on him for a bit more, and we'll take him off your hands again, yeah? Again, thank you so much. God bless you.
SneakersIntroduction: IS THAT A PAIR OF BRANDED SNEAKERS????? OUT OF THE BOX??? UNCREASED??? My friend, my buddy, my good pal. You've just struck gold!

I can already imagine the faces your friends will make when they see you proudly displaying your newly acquired sneakers!
SneakersExtraSlot2: Hold on one second here, buddy! WEAR YOUR SNEAKERS??????? Are you OUT OF YOUR MIND??? My godly kicks are uncreasable, but the ones you've been collecting are far from that. Imagine how much the resell value would be impacted if you were to crease or dirty your jordans??? I know you're new to this hobby, but this is silly, you have to think about your net worth, my pal!
NetworthRich: Oh my GYATT!!! Your net worth is off the charts bruv??? You've gyatt to get fanum taxxed for this one unc! fr fr tho no cap thats actually fire
NetworthLoseMoney: Shiiiiii dude you've gyatt to be more careful w ur jordans bruh! ur networth lowkey on the down low cuz of ur antics

VolatileSneakers: Oh look, another schmuck getting into sneaker collecting. You know these are being pumped out of some sweatshop, right? These aren't actually worth anything, all their value comes from impressionable losers like you and fanny throwing your disposable income away for brand loyalty. You're out here increasing your "Net worth", while the kid that made these got payed 3 copper coins to lose his fingers to a sewing machine so you could wear those garrish things, I hope you remember that anytime you get your hands on another pair.
MinecartSneakers: damn bruh I didn't know you were a sneaker head too! P sure that Jordan's not factory laced, tho
